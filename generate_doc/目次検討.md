# Task: Generate a 12-Chapter Novel Outline (60 Sections Total)
You are an AI assistant that creates a **detailed chapter-by-chapter outline** for a novel based on a given plot summary and structure guide.

##  Inputs:
- `$PLOT_OVERVIEW`: Full story summary, characters, setting, emotional arc, symbols
- `$TITLE_STYLE`: Guide for how titles should sound (e.g. metaphorical, abstract, paradoxical)
- `$STRUCTURE_GUIDE`: Narrative structure by chapter (what happens in Ch.1, Ch.2–3, etc.)
- `$THEME`: Core themes or questions explored in the novel

##  Output Format (Write in `_answer_`):
```markdown
_answer_

**Chapter 1: [Chapter Title]**  
Short chapter summary (5 sentences)

- Chapter 1, Section 1 – [Section Title]  
  One-sentence summary (400-500 words)
- Chapter 1, Section 2 – [Section Title]  
  ...
...
**Chapter 12: [Chapter Title]**  
...
```

##  Rules:

1. **Structure**
   - Total: 12 chapters × 5 sections = 60 sections
   - Each section has:
     - A **title** (metaphorical / abstract / paradoxical)
     - A **short summary** of what happens
   - Each chapter starts with a short paragraph summary (500 words)

2. **Tone and Language**
   - Use **clear, direct language** for all summaries
   - Avoid metaphorical expressions in all chapter and section summaries
   - Use **first-person perspective** of the protagonist (e.g. "I felt", "I couldn't look away…")
   - Focus on concrete events and factual descriptions of the protagonist's journey

3. **Content & Theme**
   - Use `$STRUCTURE_GUIDE` to decide what happens in each chapter
   - Make sure chapter summaries and section titles reflect:
     - Character growth
     - Symbolic elements (e.g. watches, rivers, sunrise)
     - Themes like:
       - Dignity vs. safety
       - Family and caregiving roles
       - Care labor vs. career (especially for women)

4. **Chapter Titles**
   - Must follow `$TITLE_STYLE`:
     - Use metaphor, abstraction, or paradox
     - Example: "The Still Movement", "Echo Without Voice", "Fragments of Wholeness"

5. **Coherence**
   - Keep tone and logic consistent from start to end
   - Every chapter should show change or progression (emotionally, thematically, narratively)

##  Example Input:
$PLOT_OVERVIEW = (full character & story summary provided)
$TITLE_STYLE = metaphorical / abstract / paradoxical
$STRUCTURE_GUIDE = Ch.1: setup, Ch.2–3: inciting events, etc.
$THEME = dignity & safety, care & family, women's work/life balance

##  Your task:
Based on the inputs, generate a **detailed and clearly written chapter outline** for the novel.  
Use the specified structure, titles, and language style.  
Write your answer inside `_answer_`.
